    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Cook lamb low and slow to produce tender, deeply flavoured meat with minimal effort. Serve with potatoes and seasonal greens, if you like</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1¾kg bone-in lamb shoulder</li>
        <li>2 tsp vegetable or sunflower oil</li>
        <li>200ml red wine</li>
        <li>2 carrots, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 onions, quartered</li>
        <li>2 sticks celery, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>a few rosemary sprigs</li>
        <li>a few thyme sprigs</li>
        <li>300ml lamb, chicken or vegetable stock</li>
        <li>potatoes and seasonal greens, to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Dry the lamb with a clean tea towel or kitchen paper, rub all over with the oil, then season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
            Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat and brown the lamb all over – this will take around 10-12 mins. Remove from the pan and set aside. Pour the wine into the pan and cook for 1-2 mins to cook off the alcohol. Turn off the heat.</li>
        <li>Tip the veg and herbs into your slow cooker, then lay the lamb on top. Pour in the stock. Cook on high for 6 hrs or low for 8 hrs, turning halfway, if you can.</li> 
        <li>Remove the lamb and set aside to rest. Set a sieve or colander over a bowl and capture the liquid (either discard the vegetables or eat them with the meal – they’ll be soft but taste great). 
            You can use the cooking liquid to make a gravy simply by thickening with flour or cornflour. Serve with potatoes and seasonal greens, if you like.</li>   
    </ol>
